# Problem Description

Merge two sorted arrays of integers into a single sorted array.

# Input

Two lines, each line describes a sorted array.  The first number in the line gives
`n`, the number of integers in the array, and the following `n` numbers give
the `n` integers in the array. All numbers are separated by space.

We can assume that 0 <= n <= 100000, and that each number in the arrarys
are in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647]. 

Your code should read the input from standard input (e.g. input()/raw_input() for Python and cin/scanf for C++).

# Output

One line, describing the merged sorted array,
with the first integer being the total number of integers in the merged array,
and the following integer give all numbers in the merged array. 

Your code should write the output to standard output (e.g. print for Python and cout/printf for C++).

# Requirement

Your algorithm should run in linear time, i.e., you are not allowed
to call any in-built sort function.

Time limtation: 5 seconds.

Memory limitation: 1.0GB.

# Environment

Your code will be running on Ubuntu 18.04.5.

Now only accept C++ and Python2/Python3 code, g++ version 7.5.0 and Python versions are Python 2.7.17 and Python 3.6.9.

# Examples

An example (input-1.txt and output-1.txt) is provided.

# Submission

If you want to upload a single file, make sure the file is named as `solution.py` or `solution.cpp`.
If you submit via GitHub, make sure your file is located in directory `assignment1/problem1/solution.py` or `assignment1/problem1/solution.cpp`.
